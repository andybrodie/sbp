<!-- To use YLAD, do the following: 
     * Adjust this configuration file to your personal needs: change entries and labels, add more items etc.
     * Anywhere in your application, for example in an application bar button click event handler, put the
       required code that initiates navigation to the about screen:

       NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/YourLastAboutDialog;component/AboutPage.xaml", UriKind.Relative));

    For more information on the powerful additional options and features of YLAD, like localization, support
    of trial mode, remote and local rich XAML and text content etc., please refer to the documentation that 
    is available at:
